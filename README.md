### Steganography: Hide Text in Image

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to easily hide secret text messages within image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method of steganography. The code leverages Tkinter for the GUI, PIL for image processing, and Stegano for the steganographic encoding and decoding.

#### Features:

- Select an image file as the carrier for the hidden message.
- Encode a text message into the selected image.
- Save the image with the hidden message.
- Retrieve and display the hidden message from an encoded image.
- Clear the input and output areas.

#### Requirements:

- Tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Stegano

Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the script.

#### Usage:

To use the application:

1.  Run the script.
2.  Open an image by clicking "Open Image."
3.  Input the text message you wish to hide in the image.
4.  Click "Hide Data" to encode the message into the image.
5.  Optionally, save the image with the hidden message using "Save Image."
6.  To retrieve the hidden message from an encoded image, click "Show Data."
7.  To clear the input and output areas, click "Clear."

#### Known Issues:

- The LSB method of steganography may not be robust against certain image processing operations, leading to potential loss of hidden data.
